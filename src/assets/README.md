# SafeSavannah Logo Placeholder

This directory should contain:
- logo.png (SafeSavannah logo)
- gunshot.mp3 (Alert sound file)

For the demo, you can:
1. Add your own logo.png file here
2. Add an alert sound file named gunshot.mp3
3. Or the app will gracefully handle missing assets

The app uses emojis as fallback icons for animals and alerts.
